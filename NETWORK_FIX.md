# RAILWAY NETWORK CONNECTION FIX

## Issue: Railway can't connect to Groq API
**Error**: "Connection error" when calling Groq API from Railway

## Solutions Applied:
1. ✅ Added 30-second timeout
2. ✅ Added retry logic (3 attempts)
3. ✅ Better error handling
4. ✅ Environment logging

## Alternative Solutions:
If connection issues persist:

### Option 1: Use OpenAI instead of Groq
- More reliable for Railway deployments
- Change in requirements.txt: `openai` instead of `groq`

### Option 2: Use Railway environment variables
- Set GROQ_API_KEY in Railway dashboard
- Ensure no firewall blocking

### Option 3: Use fallback questions only
- Disable LLM temporarily
- Use curated question bank

## Test after deployment:
1. Check `/debug/llm` endpoint
2. Look for "Running in environment" logs
3. Verify Groq API key is set in Railway
