# Sample Interview Transcript

## Interview Session: Advanced Excel Assessment

**AI Interviewer**: Hello! I'm your AI Excel interviewer. I'll be assessing your Microsoft Excel skills through a structured conversation.

The interview will take about 15-20 minutes and cover:
- Basic Excel operations and formulas
- Data analysis techniques  
- Advanced functions and best practices

Please answer as if you're explaining to a colleague. I'll evaluate your technical knowledge, efficiency of approach, and communication clarity.

Ready to begin? Let's start with some warm-up questions.

---

**AI Interviewer**: How would you calculate the sum of values in cells A1 through A10?

**Candidate**: I would use the SUM function with the syntax =SUM(A1:A10). This creates a range reference that includes all cells from A1 to A10 and calculates their total.

**AI Interviewer**: ✅ Perfect! Correct function usage and clear explanation.

---

**AI Interviewer**: What's the difference between relative and absolute cell references? Give an example.

**Candidate**: Relative references like A1 change when you copy the formula to other cells. So if I copy =A1+B1 from C1 to C2, it becomes =A2+B2. Absolute references use dollar signs like $A$1 and stay fixed when copied. Mixed references like $A1 fix the column but allow the row to change, while A$1 fixes the row but allows the column to change.

**AI Interviewer**: ✅ Excellent understanding of all reference types with clear examples.

**AI Interviewer**: You have sales data with columns: Date, Product, Region, Sales Amount. How would you find the top 3 products by total sales?

**Candidate**: I'd use a pivot table approach. Insert > Pivot Table, then drag Product to Rows and Sales Amount to Values (set to Sum). This gives me total sales by product. Then I'd sort the pivot table in descending order by sales amount to see the top products. Alternatively, I could use SUMIF functions to sum sales by product in a helper table, then use LARGE function with INDEX/MATCH to extract the top 3.

**AI Interviewer**: ✅ Great answer! Shows knowledge of multiple approaches and pivot table best practices.

**AI Interviewer**: How would you create a dynamic lookup that returns the second highest value for each category in your data?

**Candidate**: I would use an array formula with the LARGE function combined with IF for criteria. The formula would be =LARGE(IF(Category_Range=A2,Values_Range),2) entered as an array formula with Ctrl+Shift+Enter. This looks at all values where the category matches A2 and returns the second largest. In newer Excel versions, I could use MAXIFS with helper columns or the new dynamic array functions.

**AI Interviewer**: ✅ Advanced technique! Shows understanding of array formulas and modern Excel capabilities.
